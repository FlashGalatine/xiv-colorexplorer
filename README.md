# FFXIV Color Explorer

A web-based tool for Final Fantasy XIV players to explore dye colors and create harmonious color palettes for their in-game gear and housing projects.

## Features

### üé® Color Harmony Explorer
Generate color harmonies based on FFXIV's dye palette using established color theory principles:
- **Complementary** - Colors opposite on the color wheel
- **Analogous** - Colors adjacent on the color wheel
- **Triadic** - Three colors evenly spaced around the color wheel
- **Split-Complementary** - Base color plus two colors adjacent to its complement
- **Tetradic (Rectangular)** - Four colors in two complementary pairs
- **Square** - Four colors evenly spaced around the color wheel

### üîç Color Matcher
Upload an image or pick a color to find the closest matching FFXIV dye:
- Direct color picker for precise color selection
- Image upload with eyedropper tool
- Configurable sample size (1x1 to 64x64 pixels) for color averaging
- RGB Euclidean distance algorithm for accurate matching

### üí∞ Market Board Integration
Fetch real-time dye prices from the Universalis API:
- Support for all FFXIV data centers and worlds
- Selective price fetching by dye category (Base, Craft, Beast Tribe, Cosmic, Special)
