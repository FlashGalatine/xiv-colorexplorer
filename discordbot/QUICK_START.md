## What the Script Does

1. âœ… Checks prerequisites
2. âœ… Installs npm dependencies
3. âœ… Installs Wrangler CLI
4. âœ… Authenticates with Cloudflare (opens browser)
5. âœ… Sets up secrets securely
6. âœ… Deploys to Cloudflare Workers
7. âœ… Shows your worker URL

## After Deployment

Once the script finishes, you'll see your worker URL. Follow these steps:

### 1. Set Interactions Endpoint URL

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Select your application
3. Go to **General Information** tab
4. Paste your worker URL in **Interactions Endpoint URL**
5. Click **Save Changes**

### 2. Register Slash Commands

```bash
# Inside the discordbot directory
node scripts/register-commands.js
```

You'll be prompted for your Discord Token again.

### 3. Invite Bot to Server

1. Go to **OAuth2** â†’ **URL Generator**
2. Select: `bot` + `applications.commands`
3. Select: `Send Messages`, `Embed Links`, `Attach Files`
4. Copy the URL and open in browser

### 4. Test Your Bot

In Discord, try:
```
/harmony dye:"Dragoon Blue" theory:"square"
/match hex:"#0099FF"
/dye name:"Snow White"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Interactions Endpoint URL verification failed"

- Restart Discord

### "Commands don't appear"

- Wait a few minutes (Discord syncs slowly)
- Restart Discord

### "Interaction Failed"
- Check Cloudflare dashboard for errors
- Verify Interactions Endpoint URL is set in Discord Portal
- Check that secrets are set: `wrangler secret list`
