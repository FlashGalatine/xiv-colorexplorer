## Resolution Details

### Root Cause
Minified inline CSS contained invalid Tailwind directive used as CSS property:
```css
❌ INVALID: #dye-slots-container{space-y:0.5rem;}
```

### Fix Applied
Changed to proper CSS child combinator selector:
```css
✅ VALID: #dye-slots-container > * + * {margin-top:0.5rem;}
```

### Files Modified
- coloraccessibility_stable.html (Line 49)
- coloraccessibility_experimental.html (Line 49)

### Cascading Issues
The CSS parsing errors in colorexplorer and dyecomparison files were automatically resolved when the root cause was fixed.
